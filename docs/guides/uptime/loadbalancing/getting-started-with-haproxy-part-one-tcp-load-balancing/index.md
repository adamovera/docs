[HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) serves as a reverse proxy between frontend client requests and backend server resources. HAProxy can be configured at Layer 4 (network) or Layer 7 (application). The most common use of HAProxy is as an intelligent network load balancer. In this role, HAProxy routes incoming frontend traffic to designated backend instances. By default, no load balancing is applied. However, you can configure HAProxy to use various load balancing methods, including:

-   **Round Robin**: Distributes incoming connections evenly across all available backend servers by sequentially assigning each new connection to the next server in the pool.
-   **Least Conn**: Directs incoming connections to the backend server with the fewest active connections, helping to balance the load more evenly based on current server utilization.
-   **Health Checks**: Continuously monitors the health of backend servers. Servers that fail health checks are automatically removed from the pool until they recover, ensuring that only healthy servers receive traffic.

This guide demonstrates how to install HAProxy onto three common Linux distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS Stream, and openSUSE Leap. It also provides instructions for developing a proof-of-concept based on HAProxy load balancing and health check features.

## Before You Begin

1.  If you do not already have a virtual machine to use, create a Compute Instance. HAProxy can be deployed on a simple [Nanode](https://www.linode.com/blog/linode/akamai_cloud_computing_price_update/). Under **Linux Distribution**, choose either `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS`, `CentOS Stream 9`, or `openSUSE Leap 15.6`, and assign the instance to a VLAN. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/products/platform/get-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/create/) guides.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

1.  This guide uses simple WordPress backend instances to demonstrate how HAProxy controls network traffic flows at both the TCP/Network (Layer 4) and HTTP/Application (Layer 7) levels. Follow the steps in our [Deploy WordPress through the Linode Marketplace](/docs/marketplace-docs/guides/wordpress/) guide to create three backend WordPress test instances. Under **WordPress Setup**, fill out all of the required fields and use the default values, along with the following options:

    -   **The stack you are looking to deploy Wordpress on**: Choose either **LAMP** or **LEMP**.
    -   **Website title**: Enter `backend1`, `backend2`, and `backend3`, respectively.
    -   **Region**: Select the same location the HAProxy instance is in.
    -   **Linode Plan**: A **Shared CPU**, **Nanode 1 GB** is sufficient to test and demonstrate HAProxy options.
    -   **Linode Label**: Once again, enter `backend1`, `backend2`, and `backend3`, respectively.
    -   **VLAN**: Attach the instances to the same VLAN as the HAProxy instance.

    Each of these servers are generated with an `index.html` home page that indicates the name of the server (`backend1`, `backend2`, `backend3`). Open a web browser and check each server by its IP address to verify that the example test servers are functioning. Take note of the IP addresses of the three instances, as you need them later.

## Install HAProxy

To install HAProxy, log in to your HAProxy instance as `root`.

1.  Follow the instructions below for your distribution:

    {{< tabs >}}
    {{< tab "Ubuntu 24.04 LTS" >}}
    Use `apt` to install HAProxy on an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instance:

    ```command
    apt install haproxy
    ```
    {{< /tab >}}
    {{< tab "CentOS Stream 9" >}}
    Use `dnf` to install HAProxy on a CentOS Steam 9 instance:

    ```command
    dnf install haproxy
    ```
    {{< /tab >}}
    {{< tab "openSUSE Leap 15.6" >}}
    Use `zypper`to install HAProxy on a openSUSE Leap 15.6 instance:

    ```command
    zypper in haproxy
    ```
    {{< /tab >}}
    {{< /tabs >}}

1.  Verify the HAProxy installation by checking the installed version number:

    ```command
    haproxy -v
    ```

1.  Use `systemctl` to start HAProxy:

    ```command
    systemctl start haproxy
    ```

1.  Also use `systemctl` to automatically start HAProxy after a reboot:

    ```command
    systemctl enable haproxy
    ```

## The HAProxy Configuration File

HAProxy is controlled through its configuration file and the CLI. The HAProxy configuration file contains the settings needed to perform network balancing and flow control. A default configuration file is created at `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` during HAProxy installation. It can be edited with `nano` or any other command line text editor:

```command
nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

Load balancing is defined in two sections of the HAProxy configuration file: `frontend` and `backend`.

### Frontend Configuration

This is an example `frontend` configuration for TCP load balancing:

```file {title="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"}
frontend web-test
  bind *:80
  mode tcp
  default_backend web-test
```

-   `frontend` declares that this section is for a frontend configuration called `web-test`.
-   `bind` specifies the interface and port that HAProxy listens to for incoming connections. Here, `*:80` means that HAProxy listens on all available IP addresses (`*`) on port `80`, which is the standard port for web traffic.
-   `mode` is set to TCP, so that HAPRoxy handles traffic at the transport layer.
-   `default_backend` directs this traffic to a backend named `web-test`, as defined in the next section.

### Backend Configuration

```file {title="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"}
backend web-test
  mode tcp
  balance roundrobin
  server server1 {{< placeholder "backend1_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80
  server server2 {{< placeholder "backend2_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80
  server server3 {{< placeholder "backend3_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80
```

-   `backend` declares that this section is for a backend configuration called `web-test`.
-   `mode` is again set to TCP, telling HAPRoxy to handle traffic at the transport layer.
-   `balance` is set to the Round Robin method, which connects each client reaching the HAProxy server's IP address to the next server in the list.
-   `server` statements define the backend servers using the VLAN addresses specified during the initial HAProxy setup.

## TCP Health Checks with HAProxy

HAProxyâ€™s load balancing function can also select servers based on their health status. Health checks can be either active or passive. An active health check probes each backend server individually for specific health attributes. In contrast, a passive check relies on basic connection error information by protocol (Layer 4/TCP or Layer7/HTTP).

To enable a basic server health check, simply include the `check` keyword in the `server` entry of your HAProxy configuration file, like so:

```file {title="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"}
server server1 {{< placeholder "backend1_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80 check
```

When the `check` keyword is included, HAProxy sends a SYN/ACK to determine if the server is active. Even though some servers correctly respond to this type of query, their services might still be down or unavailable.

### Active Health Checks

Active health checks provide more sophisticated monitoring by sending application-specific queries to the backend servers and expecting a valid response.

Include the `inter` keyword to have HAProxy check server health at specified intervals, for example:

```file {title="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"}
server server1 {{< placeholder "backend1_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80 check inter 4
```

In this example, HAProxy checks the first server in the pool every four seconds. If the server does not respond, it is marked as down. This process is similar to a ping-type health check that verifies server availability.

### Passive Health Checks

HAProxy uses the TCP protocol to perform passive health checks on backend servers. With passive health checks, HAProxy monitors Layer 4 (TCP) traffic for errors and marks a server as down when a specified error limit is reached.

Here's an example of the syntax for a passive health check:

```file {title="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"}
server backend1 {{< placeholder "backend1_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80 check observe layer4 error-limit 10 on-error mark-down
```

This configuration specifies a passive health check that observes TCP errors (`observe layer4`). If the number of errors reaches the specified limit of 10 (`error-limit 10`), the server is marked as down (`on-error mark-down`). To optimize performance and reliability, you can adjust the intervals and error limits for different servers based on their capacity, role, or complexity. For more information, refer to the [HAProxy documentation on active health checks](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/hapee/1-8r1/load-balancing/health-checking/active-health-checks/).

## Configure HAProxy as a TCP Load Balancer with Health Checks

Set the HAProxy configuration file to perform TCP load balancing with health checks.

1.  Open the HAProxy configuration file with `nano` or another command line text editor:

    ```command
    nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    ```

1.  Append the following code to the end of the file:

    ```file {title="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"}
    frontend web-test
      bind *:80
      mode tcp
      default_backend web-test

    backend web-test
      mode tcp
      balance roundrobin
      server server1 {{< placeholder "backend1_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80 check
      server server2 {{< placeholder "backend2_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80 check
      server server3 {{< placeholder "backend3_VLAN_IP_ADDRESS" >}}:80 check
    ```

1.  After making any changes to the configuration file, use the following command to restart HAProxy and enable those changes:

    ```command
    systemctl restart haproxy
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    If you encounter an error when restarting HAProxy, run the following command to check for syntax errors in your `haproxy.cfg` file:

    ```command
    haproxy -c -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    ```
    {{< /note >}}

### Verify TCP Load Balancing

Load balancing can be verified by visiting the HAProxy instances's public IP address.

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the HAPRoxy instance's public IP address:

    ```command
    http://{{< placeholder "HAProxy_PUBIC_IP_ADDRESS" >}}
    ```

    The WordPress web page for `backend1` should appear.

1.  Open another browser tab and enter the same HAProxy server IP address. This time, the default page for `backend2` should be displayed.

1.  Repeat this process in a third browser tab, and the `backend3` server's web page should appear.

The HAProxy gateway is now successfully balancing traffic between the three backend instances.

### Verify Health Checks

Health checks can be verified by removing one of the backend instances from the server pool. This should trigger a health check failure, causing HAProxy to exclude the unresponsive server from the backend pool.

1.  Open the Cloud Manager and choose **Linodes**

1.  Click on the three dots (**...**) to the right of `backend1`.

1.  Choose **Power Off**, then click **Power Off Linode**.

1.  Reload the web browsers tabs. HAProxy should no longer route traffic to `backend1`, effectively removing it from the pool.

1.  Return to the HAProxy instance and check the logs:

    ```command
    tail -f /var/log/haproxy.log
    ```

    Your output should contain a "WARNING" line regarding the "DOWN" status of `server1`:

    ```output
    [WARNING]  (4494) : Server web-test/server1 is DOWN, reason: Layer4 connection problem, info: "No route to host", check duration: 1ms. 2 active and 0 backup servers left. 0 sessions active, 0 requeued, 0 remaining in queue.
    ```

This shows that HAProxy's TCP health checks are working as intended.
