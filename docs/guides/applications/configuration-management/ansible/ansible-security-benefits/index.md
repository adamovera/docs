[Ansible](/docs/guides/applications/configuration-management/ansible/) is an information technology (IT) tool that streamlines workflows, manages infrastructure, and replicates targeted outcomes. It is most often considered a tool for system administrators, DevOps practitioners, and related specialists. However, Ansible also has significant implications for IT security.

While Ansible enhances the security of the systems it manages, using it can also introduce risks. This trade-off often appears among the dozen items listed below.

## Agentless Architecture

One fundamental attribute of IT tooling is its dependence on agent installation. Both agent-based and agentless approaches have advantages, and both are in widespread use. Ansible is agentless and its network communications are through `ssh`. The [advantages of this approach](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-the-difference-between-agent-based-and-agentless-security) include:

-   Having no requirement to deploy agents eliminates an entire class of effort and vulnerabilities.
-   `ssh` is ubiquitous in commercial computing, and familiarity with its security profile is widespread. Broadly speaking, `ssh` is both reliable and secure.
-   Security patches for an agentless tool can take place instantaneously in the cloud, which greatly reduces the risk of hackers reaching hosts before the security team does.

Agentless implementation is lightweight and easy to adopt, start, and maintain. As a result, using Ansible can have the following benefits:

-   Consistent, predictable deployments and services.
-   Systems that fit organizational requirements.
-   The ability to install and update software quickly and reliably.

These advantages help keep intruders out, or at least minimize the damage they can cause if they do gain access.

## Secure Communication

Ansible uses `ssh` as its default transport protocol. It accesses `ssh` through standard clients and servers, or through [Paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/), a [Python](/docs/guides/development/python/) implementation of [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/). These components are well-regarded as appropriately secure for common commercial traffic. All Ansible communications are encrypted. Authentication mechanisms include public-key, password-based, and [Kerberos](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Kerberos) authentication. Ansible provides conveniences for managing `ssh` keys, and it verifies host keys upon the first connection to any new host. These practices help protect managed assets and ensure that private information does not leak.

## Idempotent Operations

Ansible emphasizes declarative and [idempotent](https://dev.to/admantium/ansible-idempotent-playbooks-4e67) actions (i.e. actions that are defined by their goals). An idempotent action is safe to repeat or replay because it only performs what is necessary to achieve the intended goal. Idempotence eliminates human errors, prevents unnecessary changes, ensures consistent system states, and promotes transparent auditing and troubleshooting. Referring all actions to explicit goals or desired states minimizes pointless actions and limits the exposure of vulnerabilities through Ansible.

Consistency is achieved when all individual assets that share the same target reach the same state. This applies whether the assets have been in use for years or were just brought online. Ansible's clear, declarative playbooks prevent two different operators from interpreting instructions differently. When a manual action leads to an inconsistent state, another idempotent invocation can bring any deviant systems back in line. Ansible's idempotency lowers the likelihood of accidents, minimizes wasted effort, promotes expert review, and therefore enhances security.

## Role-based Access Control

Role-based access control ([RBAC](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac)) assigns permissions based on a user's responsibilities and authority. RBAC is a crucial component in security planning, and Ansible's support for RBAC enhances it's security profile. Among other benefits, RBAC provides granular access to assets. This granularity helps in modelling [least privilege](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-least-privilege) or minimal privilege configurations, which are essential to current security best practices.

Ansible supports RBAC at two levels:

-   The community release of Ansible relies on Operating System (OS) mechanisms for authentication and authorization, and thus supports RBAC as well as the underlying OS does.
-   The [Ansible Tower](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/intro-ansible-tower) enterprise-class version of [Ansible fully implements and supports RBAC](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/security.html).

## Secrets Management Through Vaults

Secure systems rely on **secrets**, that is, information restricted to those with a need-to-know. The [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html) protects all kinds of secret information, including database passwords, documents with sensitive contents, and private keys. Ansible Vault offers a solution for managing sensitive information that addresses common challenges in secrets management. Ansible users do not need to generate their own schemes for protecting secrets. The Vault effectively manages access to secrets while minimizing the risk of them leaking beyond their intended recipients.

## Audit Logging

Audit logging is like RBAC in that its application varies considerably from installation to installation, especially between free Ansible and Ansible Tower. Ansible's audit logging records the details of playbook execution, such as tasks performed, changes effected, and events observed.

Audit logs have both positive and negative security implications. On the positive side, audit logs are valuable for forensic analysis and review. They help operators understand more deeply what has happened. However, audit logs must be secured and protected because they typically expose sensitive information such as system configurations and credentials. That protection needs to restrict *read* access to those with a need-to-know their contents. *Write* access to audit logs also deserves careful safeguards. Unauthorized modifications or tampering of logs has the potential to compromise the legal standing of the business and/or individuals working with these systems.

Therefore, enabling audit logs is a delicate matter. To be both useful and adequately secure, audit logs must be highly available, securely backed up, regularly monitored, periodically reviewed, and protected by granular RBAC. They must also comply with pertinent legal requirements such as GDPR or HIPAA. Additionally, audit logs should be integrated with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems when appropriate. Like other Business Continuity (BC) measures, audit logs typically receive attention during a crisis. That means their verification and practice needs to happen *before* the time of their use. Familiarity with audit logs deserves routine drills so that the logs are accurate and dependable when they are needed most.

## Source Control Integration

Configuration management with Ansible enables use of techniques that are proven successful with software development. These techniques fall under the umbrella of "[Infrastructure as Code](/docs/guides/introduction-to-infrastructure-as-code/)" (IaC). Effective IaC involves:

-   **Versioning and Change Tracking**: Keeps a detailed record of what changes are made, when, and by whom.
-   **Auditing and Compliance**: Ensures that changes to business documents are made, reviewed, and approved by authorized personnel.
-   **Consistent and Sustainable RBAC**: Links access, actions, and accountability, ensuring that only authorized users can make specific changes.
-   **Disaster Recovery and Rollback**: Facilitates recovery from failures by rolling back to a stable state.
-   **Peer Review**: Manages *concurrent* collaboration through the source control system. Multiple teams can work on different aspects of Ansible configuration simultaneously, with the system detecting conflicts before they cause issues.

The *integration* of all these elements allows you to use the same Single Sign On (SSO) passwords, development lifecycles, and permission schemes for Ansible authentication as you do for other workflows. Defects in integration can introduce surprises and complexities that pose security risks. Consistent use of IaC prevents such defects, ensuring the resulting operations are both predictable and secure.

Source control integration in Ansible enhances security by providing versioning, change tracking, access controls, accountability, and the resilience to recover from security incidents.

## Continuous Compliance Checking

Ansible's mechanisms enable compliance automation, real-time monitoring, auditing, and accountability. Ansible can help make computing systems more manageable by ensuring they are in optimal health and continuously supervised. It employs multiple layers of security mechanisms to provide comprehensive protection. These mechanisms provide confidence that configurations are performing as intended. Automation of compliance tasks reduces the need for manual intervention, minimizes dependence on specific expertise, and maximizes consistently secure results.

## Security Patching

Ansible doesn't eliminate the need for security patching, it simply enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. Ansible playbooks enable the swift, consistent, and verified application of patches. Patching is governed by Ansible's authentication and accountability mechanisms, which adhere to best security practices, and produce secure, manageable, and transparent results.

The consistency of these mechanisms enables benefits such as concurrent development. When multiple patches must be managed simultaneously, Ansible's IaC model allows different teams to prepare and test their patches *at the same time* without hindering other's progress. Concurrent patching typically resolves crises far more quickly than traditional methods.

## Custom Modules

Security work often emphasizes the use of well-known, proven techniques. Do-it-yourself encryption, for instance, is a known [recipe for failure](https://www.virtru.com/blog/homegrown-crypto-isnt-worth-the-security-risks). However, any real-world computing system is likely to involve some amount of customization to meet specific requirements. Ansible's custom modules allow for such customization by extending its base functionality in a predictable and manageable way. While custom modules present risks, using them correctly is generally preferable to any alternative method of achieving the same results.

When working with custom modules, be aware of their potential to:

-   **Allow Malicious or Erroneous Code Execution**: Custom modules can execute arbitrary code from the Ansible control node. Breakdowns can lead to data breaches, unauthorized system access, or service disruption.
-   **Escalate Privileges**: Custom modules can manipulate permissions. In the wrong circumstances, unauthorized users or users with low privileges might exploit custom modules to perform actions they otherwise could not do.
-   **Expose Information**: Passwords, API keys, and security tokens frequently appear in custom modules.
-   **Handle Inputs Insecurely**: Custom modules often receive user inputs. It is crucial to sanitize these inputs to eliminate injection vulnerabilities.
-   **Lack Proper Authentication and Authorization**: Custom modules can be misused to act far beyond their original intent.
-   **Compromise Code Integrity**: Custom modules require thorough review before being deployed to ensure they don't compromise the system.

Like any other code, custom modules require ongoing support. Even when they function well and remain unchanged, they still deserve periodic review to ensure that no pertinent security advisories affect them.

## Community and Vendor Support

One of Ansible's strengths is the extensive community and vendor support options available, along with the wealth of shared content provided by other users. While these resources are invaluable, responsibility for using Ansible ultimately rests with you. As valuable as community resources are, they deserve review before implementing them in your environment.

## Consistency of Multi-tier Environments

Ansible is suitable for managing configurations across development, testing, staging, and production environments. Consistent management across different tiers provides trustworthy results. However, multi-tier management does have security consequences. It is essential to secure private information, typically in the Ansible Vault, to prevent exposure in plaintext playbooks. Network segmentation should isolate and secure hosts to prevent unauthorized access from the Ansible control machine. Credentials and privileges deserve appropriate care, adhering to RBAC principles to ensure accountability and restricted access. Additionally, auditing and logging should record tier-specific information to identify and isolate any suspicious activities as quickly as possible.
