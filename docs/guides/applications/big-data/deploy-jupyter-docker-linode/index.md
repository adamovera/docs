This article leverages Linode cloud infrastructure and app marketplace to cloud host a containerized Jupyter and MySQL application. The Linode app marketplace helps with cloud hosting and serves as an online store where the application can be accessed, interacted with, and purchased. With Linode, you can deploy in seconds, with simple app creation procedures, customization features, and deployment management service. The Linode Marketplace enables you to deploy a containerized Jupyter and MySQL application on a Linode compute instance without the hassle of the command line.

Before deploying to Linode, you need to get your image into the remote server. This can be achieved either by building the image on the remote machine or by using a fully built image on the remote server. The latter reduces unnecessary complexity, especially if you deploy images on a public repository like Docker Hub.

Docker Hub serves as a community of repositories where Docker users create, test, manage, store, and share container images. It's free to create public repositories on Docker Hub.

## Before You Begin

1.  If you have not already done so, create a Linode account. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/products/platform/get-started/) guide.

1.  This guide requires a desktop with at least 4 GB of memory and approximately 10 GB of free space. The commands in this guide are written for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, but should generally work for other Linux distributions and operating systems.

1.  Docker is needed to follow this tutorial. The easiest way to install Docker is via the Docker Desktop package. Download the appropriate package for your operating system and follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to ensure that Docker is installed.

1.  To better understand Jupyter/Docker workflows, read the rest of the articles in this series:

    -   [How to Set Up Jupyter with Docker](/docs/guides/jupyter-docker-setup-guide/)
    -   [Managing Jupyter Data in Docker Images and Containers](/docs/guides/manage-jupyter-data-docker/)
    -   [Advanced Jupyter Data Persistence with MySQL and Docker](/docs/guides/persist-jupyter-data-mysql-docker/)

1.  Follow the instructions in our previous guide on Jupyter/Docker workflows, [Simplify Multi-Container Orchestration with Docker Compose](/docs/guides/multi-container-orchestration-docker-compose/) to set up the required examples.

## Configure Docker Hub

1.  [Sign up on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup) if you don't already have an account.

1.  Log in to your Docker Hub account and click on the **Repositories** navigation bar to create a new repository using a repository name and an optional description. You should see a UI similar to:

    ![The Docker Hub user repository page.](Docker-Hub-User-Repo.png)

1.  Open Docker Desktop, sign in with your Docker Hub account credentials, and follow the instructions to configure it.

1.  Create a connection between Docker Hub and the local machine. Open a terminal and log in to Docker:

    ```command {title="Local Machine Terminal"}
    docker login
    ```

    When prompted, enter the passphrase you created during the previous step.

## Jupyter Container

1.  View the images created by Docker compose files:

    ```command {title="Local Machine Terminal"}
    docker images
    ```

    ```output
    REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    jupyter-jupyter   latest    1d4520408d5e   17 hours ago   2.78GB
    mysql             latest    99afc808f15b   5 days ago     577MB
    ```

    ```command {title="Local Machine Terminal"}
    docker images --no-trunc
    ```

    ```output
    REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID                                                                  CREATED        SIZE
    jupyter-jupyter   latest    sha256:1d4520408d5ee6b660e62334cdfc143afcc1ef3c0113fc301e17b5f4737d111e   17 hours ago   2.78GB
    mysql             latest    sha256:99afc808f15be15cd1d9890394123034a79d1f3204d5b417d8558990cdf30167   5 days ago     577MB
    ```

1.  Upon successful login, before we push our image to the created repository, we have to rename our image to the standard format following `YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME`. We rename our docker image as follows:

    ```command {title="Local Machine Terminal"}
    docker tag jupyter-jupyter YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/project_jupyter
    ```

1.  Lastly, we push the image to Docker Hub as follows:

    ```command {title="Local Machine Terminal"}
    docker push YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/project_jupyter
    ```

    ```output
    Using default tag: latest
    The push refers to repository [docker.io/adamovera/project_jupyter]

    ```

    Once completed, your Docker Hub repository should look like this:

    ![The example Jupyter project user repository on Docker Hub.](Project-Jupyter-User-Repor-Docker-Hub.png)

1.  To pull this image from Docker Hub, use the `docker pull` command using the syntax `docker pull YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME:` as follows:

    ```command {title="Local Machine Terminal"}
    docker pull YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/project_jupyter
    ```

    ```output

## MySQL Container

Utilize the official image available on Docker Hub for the MySQL database container.

Use the following procedures to get started with Linode's Marketplace and deploy the jupyter workflow:

1.  If you have not already done so, [create a Linode account](https://login.linode.com/signup?promo=docs1000822).

1.  Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/) and select the **Marketplace** link from the left navigation menu. This should display the Linode **Create** page with the **Marketplace** tab preselected.

1.  Under the **Select App** section, select **Docker**.

1.  From the **Docker** selection, there are advanced optional configurations, including limited users, custom domain, resources to download (e.g. the URL of a hosted Dockerfile or Docker compose file), and docker commands to be run during the application creation process. Ignore these configurations.

1.  Select the `Debian` operating system release `11` as the base image.

1.  Use [Linode Speed Tests](https://www.linode.com/speed-test/) to find the best region for your current location (e.g. `Atlanta, United States`).

1.  Select the **Linode Plan** that suits your workload. **Shared CPU** plans should be fine for this exercise.

1.  Provide a root password, which is required to deploy the docker image.

1.  Click the **Create Linode** button to create a Linode compute instance with Docker installed and ready-to-use upon completion. The Linode compute instance dashboard should look similar to:

    ![The Linode dashboard of the newly created Docker instance.](Linode-Docker-Instance.png)

1.  Launch the **LISH(Linode Shell)** console to access the Docker compute instance with the login as `root` and the root password you provided during setup.

1.  In the LISH shell, create a `jupyter-mysql-net` network for the containers:

    ```command {title="LISH Console"}
    docker network create jupyter-mysql-net
    ```

1.  First, pull and run the official MySQL image on Docker Hub:

    ```command {title="LISH Console"}
    docker run -d --name mysql-db --network jupyter-mysql-net -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw mysql
    ```

    ```output
    root@139-144-16-32:~# docker run -d --name mysql-db --network jupyter-mysql-net -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw mysql

1.  Now pull and run the custom jupyter image you previously deployed to Docker Hub:

    ```command {title="LISH Console"}
    docker run -d -it -p 8888:8888 --name custom-jupyter-container --network jupyter-mysql-net YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/project_jupyter

    ![The Jupyter Launcher, or primary dashboard page.](Jupyter-Dashboard.png)

1.  Double-click on the `computation.ipynb` notebook in the left pane to open it:

    ![The empty computation.ipynb notebook file open in Jupyter.](Computation-Notebook.png)

1.  Test the containerized database hosted on Linode by persisting data to it. Paste the following code into the `computation.ipynb` notebook then press the play button to run it:

    ```file {title="computation.ipynb" lang="python"}
    import pandas as pd

    # data url in ArcGIS Hub
    data_url = "https://opendata.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/aaf4274109f34ffd93ac71267c5b276e_0/downloads/data?format=csv&spatialRefId=4326&where=1%3D1"
    data = pd.read_csv(data_url, index_col=0, nrows=1000)
    data.to_csv("outputs/Motorized-Foot-Scooter-Trips-2018.csv", index=False)

    # import neccessary libraries
    import mysql.connector
    from mysql.connector import Error
    import os

    # Reading enviroment variables
    mysql_user = os.getenv('MYSQL_USER')
    mysql_password = os.getenv('MYSQL_PASSWORD')

    # Creating MYSQL connection
    try:
        mydb_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="mysql-db",
        user=mysql_user,
        password=mysql_password)
        # Check connection
        if mydb_connection.is_connected():
            print("connection successfully")
            mycursor = mydb_connection.cursor()
            # Create database
            database_name = "scooter_trips"
            mycursor.execute(f"CREATE DATABASE {database_name}")

    except Error:
        print("Error while connecting to MySQL", Error)
    ```

    This command successfully connects to the containerized database hosted on Linode and creates a database named `scooter_trips` in it:

    ```output
    connection successfully
    ```

1.  Next, write the downloaded geospatial data to a table in the `scooter_trips` database:

    ```file {title="computation.ipynb" lang="python"}
    try:
        mydb_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="mysql-db",
        user=mysql_user,
        password=mysql_password,
        database="scooter_trips") # Added the created database to the connection

        # Check connection
        if mydb_connection.is_connected():
            print("connection successfully")
            mycursor = mydb_connection.cursor()
            mycursor.execute("SELECT database();")
            record = mycursor.fetchone()
            print("You're connected to database: ", record)
            table_name = "Motorized_Foot_Scooter_Trips_2018"
            mycursor.execute(f"CREATE TABLE {table_name} (TripID VARCHAR(255), TripDuration VARCHAR(255), TripDistance VARCHAR(255), StartTime VARCHAR(255), EndTime VARCHAR(255), StartCenterlineID VARCHAR(255), StartCenterlineType VARCHAR(255), EndCenterlineID VARCHAR(255), EndCenterlineType VARCHAR(255))")
            print(f"{table_name} table created")
            for index, row in data.iterrows():
                sql = f"INSERT INTO scooter_trips.{table_name} (TripID, TripDuration, TripDistance, StartTime, EndTime, StartCenterlineID, EndCenterlineID) VALUES (%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s)"
                mycursor.execute(sql, list(row))
                # the connection is not auto committed by default, so we must commit to save our changes
                mydb_connection.commit()
    except Error:
        print("Error while connecting to MySQL", Error)
    ```

    This command successfully persists data to the containerized database:

    ```output
    connection successfully
    You're connected to database:  ('scooter_trips',)
    Motorized_Foot_Scooter_Trips_2018 table created
    ```

1.  You can now query data from the database:

    ```file {title="computation.ipynb", lang="python"}
    try:
        mydb_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="mysql-db",
        user=mysql_user,
        password=mysql_password,
        database="scooter_trips") # Added the created database to the connection

        # Check connection
        if mydb_connection.is_connected():
            print("connection successfully")
            mycursor = mydb_connection.cursor()
            mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Motorized_Foot_Scooter_Trips_2018 limit 5")
            myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
            for x in myresult:
                print(x)
    except Error:
        print("Error while connecting to MySQL", Error)
    ```

    ```output
    connection successfully
    ('154744', '256', '1108', '2018/07/10 12:00:00+00', '2018/07/10 12:00:00+00', '16914', '16914')
    ('154745', '185', '519', '2018/07/10 12:00:00+00', '2018/07/10 12:00:00+00', '17104', '17872')
    ('154742', '177', '496', '2018/07/10 12:30:00+00', '2018/07/10 12:30:00+00', '17117', '17865')
    ('154743', '344', '929', '2018/07/10 12:30:00+00', '2018/07/10 12:30:00+00', '16632', '17117')
    ('154741', '176', '588', '2018/07/10 12:59:59+00', '2018/07/10 12:59:59+00', '21654', '17250')
    ```

Everything works as it should, fully containerized and cloud-hosted on Linode. You can observe the application's resources utilization, work load, network traffic, and configuration from the Linode compute instance's dashboard:

## Conclusion

This tutorial covers deploying a functioning Jupyter and MySQL application, containerized with Docker, to the cloud with the Linode app marketplace. However, the lessons learned here can be applied to any application. Knowing how to deploy images to Docker Hub and then re-deploy them to a cloud server can open many doors.

This concludes our series on Jupyter/Docker workflows. The rest of the series teaches you numerous ways to create a Jupyter instance, store its data, and containerize it. Find those links above in the [Before You Begin](/docs/guides/deploy-jupyter-docker-linode/#before-you-begin) section to learn more.
