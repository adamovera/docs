The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently [released](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards) its first finalized Post-Quantum Encryption Standards to protect against quantum computer attacks. This includes the Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism standard (ML-KEM, defined in [FIPS-203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final). It is already being implemented in the industry using an early [pre-standardization draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00/) for use with TLS.

Deploying this algorithm for your web server currently requires some additional steps. The process may vary depending on your operating system's version of OpenSSL. This guide shows you how to build OpenSSL 3.x and the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) provider on Debian 11. For instructions on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, please see [this document](https://collaborate.akamai.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1012558967).

## Before You Begin

1.  If you do not already have a virtual machine to use, create a Compute Instance with at least 4 GB of memory using Debian 11. See our [Getting Started with Linode](/docs/products/platform/get-started/) and [Creating a Compute Instance](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/create/) guides.

1.  Follow our [Setting Up and Securing a Compute Instance](/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/set-up-and-secure/) guide to update your system. You may also wish to set the timezone, configure your hostname, create a limited user account, and harden SSH access.

1.  Read our [Understanding TLS Certificates and Connections](/docs/guides/what-is-a-tls-certificate/) to ensure that you're familiar with the basics of TLS encryption.

{{< note >}}
This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Users and Groups](/docs/guides/linux-users-and-groups/) guide.
{{< /note >}}

### Install Dependencies

Once your Debian 11 compute instance is set up and secured, install the dependencies and system packages needed to build OpenSSL and the OQS provider.

1.  Update your package list to ensure you download the latest available versions:

    ```command
    sudo apt update
    ```

1.  Install `make`, a build automation tool used to compile and link programs from source code. It reads instructions from a Makefile, which defines how to compile and build the software:

    ```command
    sudo apt install -y make
    ```

1.  Install `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection), which compiles source code written in languages like C and C++ into executable programs. It is essential for building OpenSSL and other software from source code:

    ```command
    sudo apt install -y gcc
    ```

## Install OpenSSL from Source

Debian 11 comes with OpenSSL version 1.1.1w by default, but the OQS provider requires OpenSSL 3.x. Therefore, you need to build a newer version from source.

1.  Download the OpenSSL source code:

    ```command
    wget https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/download/openssl-3.3.2/openssl-3.3.2.tar.gz
    ```

1.  Download the corresponding signature file:

    ```command
    wget https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/download/openssl-3.3.2/openssl-3.3.2.tar.gz.asc
    ```

### Verify the OpenSSL Code Signature

Before proceeding with the installation, verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded files using GnuPG (`gnupg`).

1.  First, install `gnupg`:

    ```command
    sudo apt -y install gnupg
    ```

1.  Next, import the public OpenSSL signing key:

    ```command
    gpg --search-keys openssl@openssl.org
    ```

    When prompted, press the <kbd>1</kbd> key followed by <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to choose the key from `openssl@openssl.org`:

    ```output
    gpg: data source: https://keys.openpgp.org:443
    (1) OpenSSL <openssl@openssl.org>
          4096 bit RSA key 216094DFD0CB81EF, created: 2024-04-08
    Keys 1-1 of 1 for "openssl@openssl.org".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > 1
    ```

    Afterward, you should see output similar to the following:

    ```output
    gpg: key 216094DFD0CB81EF: public key "OpenSSL <openssl@openssl.org>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:           	imported: 1
    ```

1.  Verify the fingerprint pf the imported key to ensure it matches OpenSSL's official key:

    ```command
    gpg --fingerprint openssl@openssl.org
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following:

    ```output
    pub   rsa4096 2024-04-08 [SC] [expires: 2026-04-08]
          BA54 73A2 B058 7B07 FB27  CF2D 2160 94DF D0CB 81EF
    uid       	[ unknown] OpenSSL <openssl@openssl.org>
    ```

1.  Finally, verify the OpenSSL source file against its signature:

    ```command
    gpg --verify openssl-3.3.2.tar.gz.asc openssl-3.3.2.tar.gz
    ```

    You should see a confirmation similar to the output below:

    ```output
    gpg: Signature made Tue Sep  3 08:46:51 2024 EDT
    gpg:            	using RSA key BA5473A2B0587B07FB27CF2D216094DFD0CB81EF
    gpg: Good signature from "OpenSSL <openssl@openssl.org>" [ultimate]
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    If you see a warning message about not having a trusted path to the OpenSSL key, it does not impact the validity of the signature. The warning message appears because the OpenSSL signing key has not yet been marked as "trusted" in your GnuPG keyring.
    {{< /note >}}

### Build OpenSSL

After verifying the source code, the next step is to build OpenSSL form source.

1.  Extract the downloaded OpenSSL archive:

    ```command
    tar zxf openssl-3.3.2.tar.gz
    ```

1.  Change into the extracted OpenSSL source directory:

    ```command
    cd openssl-3.3.2
    ```

1.  Configure the OpenSSL build, specifying the installation path (`/opt` in this case) and setting the appropriate runtime library search path:

    ```command
    ./Configure --prefix=/opt '-Wl,-rpath,$(LIBRPATH)'
    ```

1.  Use `make` to compile the OpenSSL source code:

    ```command
    make
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    This process may take a few minutes depending on your system.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Install the compiled OpenSSL files to the specified location:

    ```command
    sudo make install
     ```

    {{< note >}}
    This process may take a few minutes depending on your system.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Verify that OpenSSL is correctly installed and that the correct version is active:

    ```command
    /opt/bin/openssl version
    ```

    This should return the version number of the OpenSSL build:

    ```output
    OpenSSL 3.3.2
    ```

{{< note >}}
At this point, you probably want to add `/opt/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.

1.  Open your `~/.bashrc` file in a command line text editor such as `nano`:

    ```command
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Append the following line to the end of the file:

    ```file {title="~/.bashrc"}
    export PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH
    ```

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Apply the changes:

    ```command
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
{{< /note >}}

## Install `oqs-provider`

### Install Dependencies and Clone the `oqs-provider` Repository

A couple of required dependencies must be installed prior to `oqs-provider`:

-   `cmake`: A cross-platform build system generator that helps automate the compilation and build process for software projects.
-   `ninja-build`: A build system designed to run builds in parallel, which reduces the compilation time of large projects.

1.  Install the required dependencies, along with `git`:

    ```command
    sudo apt install -y git cmake ninja-build
    ```

1.  Use `git` to clone the `oqs-provider` repository from GitHub:

    ```command
    git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider.git
    ```

1.  Change into the `oqs-provider` directory:

    ```command
    cd oqs-provider
    ```

### Build `oqs-provider`

1.  Temporarily add `/opt/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable if not already:

    ```command
    export PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH
    ```

1.  Set the OpenSSL root directory and build the `oqs-provider` using the provided script:

    ```command
    env OPENSSL_ROOT=/opt CMAKE_PARAMS="-DOPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY=/opt/lib64/libcrypto.so" bash scripts/fullbuild.sh
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    This process may take a few minutes depending on your system.
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Use `cmake` to install the compiled `oqs-provider`:

    ```command
    sudo cmake --install _build
    ```

1.  Run the test suite to verify the `oqs-provider` build:

    ```command
    scripts/runtests.sh
    ```

### Configure OpenSSL to Use the OQS Provider

1.  Use a command line text editor such as `nano` to edit the OpenSSL configuration file:

    ```command
    sudo nano /opt/ssl/openssl.cnf
    ```

    Add the following lines at the end:

    ```file {title="/opt/ssl/openssl.cnf"}
    # PQC via OpenQuantumSafe
    [provider_sect]
    default = default_sect
    oqsprovider = oqsprovider_sect

    [default_sect]
    activate = 1

    [oqsprovider_sect]
    activate = 1
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    In this case, you are editing the `/opt/ssl/openssl.cnf file, not the configuration file for the system OpenSSL!
    {{< /note >}}

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

### Check Provider Version Information

1.  List the active OpenSSL providers to verify the installation:

    ```command
    openssl list -providers
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following:

    ```output
    Providers:
      default
        name: OpenSSL Default Provider
        version: 3.3.2
        status: active
      oqsprovider
        name: OpenSSL OQS Provider
        version: 0.6.2-dev
        status: active
    ```

## Install Nginx from Source

The version of Nginx available for Debian 11 uses OpenSSL version 1.1.1w. In order to use OpenSSL 3.x, you must build Nginx from source.

### Fetch Nginx Source

1.  Use `wget` to download the Nginx source files:

    ```command
    wget https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.26.2.tar.gz
    ```

1.  Also download the corresponding signature for verification:

    ```command
    wget https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.26.2.tar.gz.asc
    ```

### Verify the Signature

1.  Download the public key:

    ```command
    wget https://nginx.org/keys/pluknet.key
    ```

1.  Import the key:

    ```command
    gpg --import pluknet.key
    ```

1.  Verify the signature:

    ```command
    gpg --verify nginx-1.26.2.tar.gz.asc nginx-1.26.2.tar.gz
    ```

    You should see output similar to the below if verification succeeds:

    ```output
    gpg: Signature made Tue Aug 13 08:48:05 2024 EDT
    gpg:            	using RSA key D6786CE303D9A9022998DC6CC8464D549AF75C0A
    gpg:            	issuer "s.kandaurov@f5.com"
    gpg: Good signature from "Sergey Kandaurov <s.kandaurov@f5.com>" [unknown]
    gpg:             	aka "Sergey Kandaurov <pluknet@nginx.com>" [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: The key's User ID is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:      	There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: D678 6CE3 03D9 A902 2998  DC6C C846 4D54 9AF7 5C0A
    ```

    {{< note >}}
    Nginx uses individual developer keys to sign its releases, so don't be alarmed if you see unfamiliar names during verification. If verification fails, additional signing keys can be found at [https://nginx.org/en/pgp_keys.html](https://nginx.org/en/pgp_keys.html).
    {{< /note >}}

### Install Dependencies

A couple of libraries are required before building Nginx:

1.  Install `zlib1g-dev`, a compression library for handling compressed content:

    ```command
    sudo apt install -y zlib1g-dev
    ```

1.  Install `libcre3` and `libcre3-dev` to support regular expressions, often used for URL matching:

    ```command
    sudo apt install -y libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
    ```

### Build Nginx

Except for the destination prefix, this example uses the same configuration parameters as the binary package. This is to retain feature parity and integrate with system scripts. The last three options passed to the `configure` script are necessary to use the OpenSSL version built earlier.

1.  Extract the source:

    ```command
    tar zxf nginx-1.26.2.tar.gz
    ```

1.  Change into the extracted source directory:

    ```command
    cd nginx-1.26.2
    ```

1.  Configure the build with the necessary flags:

    ```command
    ./configure --with-cc-opt='-g -O2 -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -fPIC -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2' \
        --with-ld-opt='-Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -fPIC'      \
        --prefix=/opt                                      \
        --conf-path=/opt/nginx/nginx.conf              	\

        --with-http_auth_request_module                	\
        --with-http_v2_module                          	\
        --with-http_dav_module                         	\
        --with-http_slice_module                       	\
        --with-threads                                 	\
        --with-http_addition_module                    	\
        --with-http_gunzip_module                      	\
        --with-http_gzip_static_module                 	\
        --with-http_sub_module                         	\
        --with-pcre                                    	\
        --with-openssl-opt=enable-tls1_3               	\
        --with-ld-opt="-L/opt/lib64 -Wl,-rpath,/opt/lib64" \
        --with-cc-opt="-I/opt/include"
    ```

1.  Compile Nginx:

    ```command
    make
    ```

1.  Install Nginx:

    ```command
    sudo make install
    ```

1.  Create the necessary directories for temporary file storage:

    ```command
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/nginx
    ```

1.  Create a directory for additional configuration files:

    ```command
    sudo mkdir /opt/nginx/conf.d
    ```

### Configure Nginx

1.  Edit the main Nginx configuration file:

    ```command
    sudo nano /opt/nginx/nginx.conf
    ```

    Add the following line to the top of the file to specify the user:

    ```file {title="/opt/nginx/nginx.conf"}
    user www-data; #add this to the top of the file
    ```

    Locate the `http` block and add the highlighted lines to include configuration files in the `/opt/nginx/nginx.conf` directory:

    ```file {title="/opt/nginx/nginx.conf" hl_lines="2,3"}
    http {
   	    #Include additional configuration files
	    include /opt/nginx/conf.d/pqc.conf;
        ...
    }
    ```

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Create a server configuration file called `pqc.conf` in the `/opt/nginx/conf.d/` directory:

    ```command
    sudo nano /opt/nginx/conf.d/pqc.conf
    ```

    Give it the following contents:

    ```file {title="/opt/nginx/conf.d/pqc.conf"}
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        listen [::]:443 ssl;
        server_name {{< placeholder "example.com" >}} {{< placeholder "www.example.com" >}};

        root {{< placeholder "/var/www/example.com" >}};
        index index.html index.php;

        ssl_certificate /opt/certs/{{< placeholder "example.com" >}}.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /opt/certs/{{< placeholder "example.com" >}}.key;

        ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_ecdh_curve x25519_kyber768:p384_kyber768:x25519:secp384r1:x448:secp256r1:secp521r1;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }
    ```

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

    {{< note >}}
    Ensure that you include the necessary certificates (whether self-signed or from a trusted Certificate Authority) to enable proper TLS/SSL functionality. Without certificates, you wonâ€™t be able to establish a secure HTTPS connection.

    -   **Using Let's Encrpyt (Recommedned for Production)**: To use automatic certificate renewal with Let's Encrypt, follow [Use Certbot to Enable HTTPS with NGINX on Ubuntu](/docs/guides/enabling-https-using-certbot-with-nginx-on-ubuntu/) to properly configure the Nginx server.

    -   **Using Self-Signed Certificate (Suitable for Testing/Development)**: To use a self-signed certificate, see our [Enable TLS/SSL for HTTPS](/docs/guides/getting-started-with-nginx-part-3-enable-tls-for-https/) guide, or create certificates using the following command:

        1.  First create the directory for your certificates:

        ```command
        sudo mkdir /opt/certs
        ```

        2.  Then generate the self-signed certificate:

        ```command
        sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /opt/certs/pqc.com.key -out /opt/certs/pqc.com.crt
        ```
    {{< /note >}}

1.  Create a `systemd` service file for Nginx:

    ```command
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service
    ```

    Give it the following contents:

    ```file {title="/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service"}
    [Unit]
    Description=The NGINX HTTP and reverse proxy server
    After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    PIDFile=/run/nginx.pid
    ExecStartPre=/opt/sbin/nginx -t
    ExecStart=/opt/sbin/nginx
    ExecReload=/opt/sbin/nginx -s reload
    ExecStop=/opt/sbin/nginx -s stop
    PrivateTmp=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    When done, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the file and exit `nano`.

1.  Start the Nginx service:

    ```command
    sudo service nginx start
    ```

Nginx should now be installed, configured, and running with OpenSSL 3.x support.

## Verify that Nginx Is Using Post-Quantum Algorithms

The quickest and easiest way to test the algorithms used by Nginx is to run the `openssl` command shown below:

```command
openssl s_client -groups x25519_kyber768 -connect localhost:443
```

This command specifically checks for the `X25519_Kyber768` algorithm during a TLS connection. For additional methods, see our [Ubuntu-PQC guide](https://collaborate.akamai.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1012558967).
